<h1>Pre-compiled binaries</h2>

This  directory contains a few pre-compiled binaries. If you do not wish to compile your own, one of these may work for you "out-of-the-box".

To run it from the distribution directory set this environment variable to the appropriate location of the top-level directory (where `Help/` and `Images/` are, for example 
```export EXTREMA_DIR=~/extrema-x.y.z```
and then run run the appropriate executable from the command line, for example 
```$EXTREMA_DIR/bin/eXtrema-4.6.0-x86_64.appimage```
 
<ul>
 <li><a href="eXtrema-x86_64.AppImage">eXtrema-x86_64.AppImage</a> - (24MB) a self-contained AppImage executable for most Linux distros (made under RHEL 7, wxWidgets 3.1.5). Use <code>chmod -m 755 eXtrema-x86_64.AppImage</code> to make the file executable before running it</li>
 <li><a href="eXtrema-4.6.2.zip">eXtrema-4.6.2.zip</a> - (17MB) Windows (32-bit, should work on 32- and 64-bit hardware, under older and newer Windows versions) binary, wxWidgets 3.1.5. This zip file already contains all of the files you need, including the Windows executable, sample scripts and documentation; unzip this anywhere (e.g. as <code>C:\Programs\eXtrema-462\</code>), and double-click on the <code>extrema.exe</code> file. You should also install FreeFonts from <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/freefont/" target="_blank">https://www.gnu.org/software/freefont/</a>.</li>
