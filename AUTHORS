===============

EXTREMA has evolved from software developed over the years at TRIUMF, Canada's national
laboratory for particle and nuclear physics.  The need for a general purpose graphics
and analysis package was seen early and the first such program was OPDATA, created,
using FORTRAN, by C.J. Kost, Philip Bennett, and Arthur Haynes.

The next program, PLOTDATA, also in FORTRAN, used many ideas from OPDATA, but had a
different, more user friendly, interface, and was created by Joseph Chuma in 1983.  At
the heart of OPDATA and PLOTDATA was the expression evaluator, but it was limited in
that only element-by-element operations were possible, and variable indices were not
allowed in expressions.  Philip Bennett and Joseph Chuma re-wrote the expression
evaluator, again in FORTRAN, allowing for array operations and indices on variables,
functions, and entire expressions.  This work was incorporated into a new program,
PHYSICA, which also introduced many other new graphics and analysis features. After
a few aborted attempts at creating a GUI for PHYSICA, EXTREMA for Microsoft Windows
was born.

EXTREMA was written completely in C++ by Joe Chuma using Borland C++Builder 5.
This version of EXTREMA has now been ported to Linux using wxWidgets, an open source
cross-platform toolkit.  This wxWidgets version of EXTREMA will now be ported back to
Windows so developers will not be forced to purchase any commercial products.

EXTREMA makes use of the wxWidgets toolkit, which is "a single, easy-to-use API for
writing GUI applications on multiple platforms that still utilize the native platform's
controls and utilities."  Information on the wxWidgets project can be found at 
http://wxwidgets.org

EXTREMA also makes use of the Z Library, which is "a free, general-purpose, legally
unencumbered lossless data-compression library for use on virtually any computer
hardware and operating system", and the PNG Library.  PNG is "the Portable Network
Graphics format, a format for storing bitmapped (raster) images on computers", and 
libpng is "the official PNG reference library".  Information on the zlib library can
be found at http://www.zlib.net, while information on the libpng library can be found
at http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html

EXTREMA makes use of the XML2 Library, which is "the XML C parser and toolkit developed
for the Gnome project (but usable outside of the Gnome platform), it is free software
available under the MIT License."  Information on the libxml2 library can be found at 
http://xmlsoft.org/index.html
