<p>
 The <CODE>SAVGOL</CODE> function calculates a smooth curve through
 the data contained in vector <CODE>y</CODE>, the dependent variable, using
 the Savitzky-Golay smoothing filter method. The order of the filter is given in scalar
 <CODE>n</CODE>, which currently can only be <code>2</code> or
 <code>4</code>. The filter width is given in scalar <CODE>m</CODE>.
 These filters preserve the area under the data, the zero<sup>th</sup> moment, but also the
 higher moments.</p>
<p>
 There is no input independent variable, as the data is assumed to be equally spaced.</p>
<p>
 As a rough guideline, best results are obtained when the filter width of the order <code>4</code>
 Savitzky-Golay filter is between one and two times the full width half maximum (FWHM) of
 desired features in the data.</p>
