 Very often, the data to be fitted is a histogram of physical events. In that
 case, since each bin would follow a multinomial distribution, the error is
 equal to <code>&radic;<i>f</i></code>, where <i>f</i> is the expression you are trying to fit.
 Of course, since you don't know the parameter values yet, you don't actually
 know <i>f</i>, so you approximate by using the <i>y</i> data values.  In the
 limit, these results are the same. In the case of a large number of bins, the
 variance can be approximated by <code>&radic;y</code>. Hence, the correct
 weighting factor that will give properly normalized errors is <i>w = 1/y</i>,
 and the corresponding one standard deviation error,
 <font size="+1"><code>&sigma; = E2/sqrt(&chi;<sup>2</sup>/n)</code></font>, where
 <code>E2</code> is the standard error and <code>n</code> is the number of degrees of freedom, usually
 equal to the number of data points minus the number of parameters,
 <code>(N-M)</code>.</P>
