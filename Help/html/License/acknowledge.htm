<font size=-1 face="Arial black" color="red">EXTREMA</font> has evolved from software
developed over the years at TRIUMF, Canada's national laboratory for particle and nuclear
physics.  The need for a general purpose graphics and analysis package was seen early and
the first such program was OPDATA, created, using FORTRAN, by C.J. Kost, Philip Bennett,
and Arthur Haynes.
The next program, PLOTDATA, also in FORTRAN, used many ideas from OPDATA, but had a different, more
user friendly, interface, and was created by Joseph Chuma in 1983.  At the heart of OPDATA and PLOTDATA
was the expression evaluator, but it was limited in that only element-by-element operations
were possible, and variable indices were not allowed in expressions.  Philip Bennett and
Joseph Chuma re-wrote the expression evaluator, again in FORTRAN, allowing for array operations and indices
on variables, functions, and entire expressions.  This work was incorporated into a new
program, PHYSICA, which also introduced many other new graphics and analysis features. After
a few aborted attempts at creating a GUI for PHYSICA using X-Designer<font size=-2>&#64;</font>
for Motif<font size=-2>&#64;</font>, <font size=-1 face="Arial black" color="red">EXTREMA</font>
for Microsoft Windows<font size=-2>&#64;</font> was born.
<font size=-1 face="Arial black" color="red">EXTREMA</font> was written completely in C++ by Joe Chuma,
and currently must be built with Borland
C++Builder<font size=-2>&#64;</font> running under windows32.  This version of
<font size=-1 face="Arial black" color="red">EXTREMA</font> has now been
ported to Linux using wxWidgets, an open source cross-platform toolkit.  This wxWidgets version
of <font size=-1 face="Arial black" color="red">EXTREMA</font> will now be ported back to Windows so developers
will not be forced to purchase any commercial products.</P>

<font size=-1 face="Arial black" color="red">EXTREMA</font>
makes use of the <B>wxWidgets</B> toolkit, which is "a single, easy-to-use API for writing
GUI applications on multiple platforms that still utilize the native platform's controls and
utilities."  Information on the <B>wxWidgets</B> project can be found at 
<code><font color="blue">http://wxwidgets.org</font></code>.</P>
<P>
<font size=-1 face="Arial black" color="red">EXTREMA</font>
also makes use of the <B>Z Library</B>, which is "a free, general-purpose,
 legally unencumbered lossless data-compression library for use on
 virtually any computer hardware and operating system", and the
 <B>PNG Library</B>.  <B>PNG</B> is "the Portable Network Graphics format, a
 format for storing bitmapped (raster) images on computers", and 
 <B>libpng</B> is "the official PNG reference library".  Information on the
 <B>zlib</B> library can be found at
 <code><font color="blue">http://www.zlib.net</font></code>, while
 information on the <B>libpng</B> library can be found at <code><font color="blue">http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html</font></code></P>
<P>
<font size=-1 face="Arial black" color="red">EXTREMA</font>
makes use of the <B>XML2 Library</B>, which is "the XML C parser and toolkit developed for the Gnome project
(but usable outside of the Gnome platform), it is free software available under the MIT License."
Information on the <B>libxml2</B> library can be found at 
<code><font color="blue">http://xmlsoft.org/index.html</font></code>.
