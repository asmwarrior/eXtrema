<font size=-1 face="Arial black" color="red">EXTREMA</font> has evolved from software
developed over the years at TRIUMF, Canada's national laboratory for particle and nuclear
physics.  The need for a general purpose graphics and analysis package was seen early and
the first such program was OPDATA, created, using FORTRAN, by C.J. Kost, Philip Bennett,
and Arthur Haynes.
The next program, PLOTDATA, also in FORTRAN, used many ideas from OPDATA, but had a different, more
user friendly, interface, and was created by Joseph Chuma in 1983.  At the heart of OPDATA and PLOTDATA
was the expression evaluator, but it was limited in that only element-by-element operations
were possible, and variable indices were not allowed in expressions.  Philip Bennett and
Joseph Chuma re-wrote the expression evaluator, again in FORTRAN, allowing for array operations and indices
on variables, functions, and entire expressions.  This work was incorporated into a new
program, PHYSICA, which also introduced many other new graphics and analysis features. After
a few aborted attempts at creating a GUI for PHYSICA using X-Designer<font size=-2>&#64;</font>
for Motif<font size=-2>&#64;</font>, EXTREMA for Microsoft Windows<font size=-2>&#64;</font> was born.
EXTREMA was written completely in C++ by Joe Chuma, and currently must be built with Borland
C++Builder<font size=-2>&#64;</font> running under windows32, but plans are underway to convert it to
wxWidgets<font size=-2>&#64;</font>, an Open Source alternative, and then port it to Linux and OSX.
