<font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" color="red">eXtrema</font> has evolved from software
developed over the years at TRIUMF, Canada's national laboratory for particle and nuclear
physics.  The need for a general purpose graphics and analysis package was seen early and
the first such program was OPDATA, created, using FORTRAN, by <b>Corrie J. Kost</b>, <b>Philip Bennett</b>,
and <b>Arthur Haynes</b>.
The next program, PLOTDATA, also in FORTRAN, used many ideas from OPDATA, but had a different, more
user friendly, interface, and was created by <b>Joseph Chuma</b> in 1983.  At the heart of OPDATA and PLOTDATA
was the expression evaluator, but it was limited in that only element-by-element operations
were possible, and variable indices were not allowed in expressions.  Philip Bennett and
Joseph Chuma re-wrote the expression evaluator, again in FORTRAN, allowing for array operations and indices
on variables, functions, and entire expressions.  This work was incorporated into a new
program, PHYSICA, which also introduced many other new graphics and analysis features. After
a few aborted attempts at creating a GUI for PHYSICA using X-Designer<font size="-1">&reg;</font>
for Motif<font size="-1">&reg;</font>, <font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" color="red">eXtrema</font>
for Microsoft Windows<font size="-1">&reg;</font> was born.
<font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" color="red">eXtrema</font> for Windows was written completely in
C++ by Joseph Chuma using Borland C++Builder<font size="-1">&reg;</font> and later ported to Linux using 
<a href="http://wxwidgets.org"><font color="blue">wxWidgets</font></a>, an open source cross-platform toolkit.

Since 2012, <b>Edward Sternin</b> has maintained the code so that it could be compiled, but otherwise made no changes.
In 2021, <font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" color="red">eXtrema</font> was moved to GitHub and 
<b>Vadim Zeitlin</b> of <a href="https://www.tt-solutions.com">TT-solutions</a> helped to update it for GTK3/wxWidgets 3.x.
