Version 4.1.3
-------------
Bug fixes:

* "make install" did not copy the image directory (for buttons) or the help file directory (for
  online help) to the proper location.  These directories have new names, extremaImages/ and
  extremaHelp/, and should now be copied to the $(prefix)/share directory on a make install, where
  $(prefix) is the directory mentioned with the configure command, which defaults to /usr/local.

* It seems the latest compilers do not like unnecessary class qualifiers in header files.
  This required modifying src/Commands/CMD_density.h, src/Commands/Command.h,
  src/Functions/ScalarFunction.h, and src/Graphics/GRA_window.h
  Thanks to S. Umar for finding this and suggesting the simple fix.

* The optional grid lines (controlled by characteristics YGRID and XGRID) were being drawn in the
  color of the last text string drawn.  This has now been fixed, and they are drawn using the
  corresponding axis color (YAXISCOLOR or XAXISCOLOR).
