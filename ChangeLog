	v4.2.3

	* modified src/wxForms/VisualizationSpeedButtonPanel
	Minor bug fix for PostScript output: if the .eps extension was not
	supplied, the plot file was created but not completed.  If the .eps
	extension was supplied, everything was ok.  This is now fixed.

	* modified src/Commands/CMD_graph
	Minor bug fix:  if the legend is off and a string is supplied as the
	first argument to the GRAPH command, an error occurred.  The string
	is now ignored, as specified in the documentation.

	v4.2.2

	* added src/Commands/CMD_ellipse
	New command ELLIPSE can be used to populate an ellipse given the major- and
	minor-axes, centre, and angle; or it can be used to fit an ellipse to a
	set of data.  The Help files have also been updated.

	* added src/Commands/CMD_polygon
	New command POLYGON takes the coordinates for a polygon and some data coordinates,
	and returns a vector indicating which data points are inside/outside the polygon.
	The Help files have also been updated.

	v4.2.1

	* modified src/wxForms/VisualizationWindow, SetAspectRatioForm
	Minor changes to allow linking with wxGTK v2.6.3
	
	* modified src/wxForms/VisualizationWindow, src/Utilities/ExGlobals,
	src/wxForms/SetAspectRatioForm.  Minor fixes for aspect ratio changes,
	hidden pages were not being reset properly.

	* added src/Commands/CMD_alias, CMD_dealias.
	New command ALIAS allows the user to create new commands out of the
	current commands.  New command DEALIAS is used to remove an alias.
	
08/05/2007  Joe Chuma <chuma@triumf.ca>

	v4.2.0
	
	* added src/wxForms/GraphicsPage, src/Commands/CMD_page.  These allow for
	multiple graphics pages in a tabbed format.  A new graphics page adds another
	tab in the visualization window.  Use the speed buttons on the visualization
	window, or the PAGE command, to add/remove pages.

	* added src/wxForms/SetAspectRatioForm.  This allows for interactively changing
	the aspect ratio.
	
	* modified src/Utilities/ExGlobals, src/wxForm/VisualizationWindow to fix up
	the SAVE/RESTORE feature for multiple graphics pages.
	
	* modified src/Graphics/GRA_postscript to break up long sets of "lineto"s in
	order to speed up ghostview display of postscript files, also included shorter
	names for "lineto", "moveto", and "stroke", to make the files smaller.
	
	* modified src/Commands/CMD_get,CMD_set to modify orientation, which now
	uses aspectratio.  For letter size paper, use SET ASPECTRATIO 8.5/11 to
	get landscape orientation, and use SET ASPECTRATIO 11/8.5 to get portrait
	orientation.

18/04/2007  Joe Chuma <chuma@triumf.ca>

	v4.1.10

	* added src/Functions/FCN_asinh,FCN_acosh,FCN_atanh,FCN_asech,FCN_acsch,FCN_acoth,
	FCN_cosh,FCN_sinh,FCN_tanh,FCN_sech,FCN_csch,FCN_coth the hyperbolic trig
	functions (I simply forgot to include them before)

	* added src/Graphics/GRA_postscript (a PostScript driver) to fix up the PostScript
	output, i.e., it is now encapsulated postscript (with a bounding box), and the
	Greek characters and the math symbols should now appear in the postscript output

	
30/03/2007  Joe Chuma <chuma@triumf.ca>

	v4.1.9

	* modified src/Commands/CMD_execute to fix a bug in appending the current
	path to a filename.  The / was missing before the filename.

	* modified src/Commands/CMD_inquire,CMD_execute,CMD_text,CMD_quit,CMD_if,
	CMD_pause,CMD_set,CMD_get,CMD_return and src/Graphics/GRA_drawableText and
	src/Parsing/Script and src/Utilities/ExGlobals and
	src/wxForms/AnalysisMessagePanel,CommandTextCtrl,ExecuteDialog,
	VisualizationWindow,AnalysisWindow to fix script handling.  Previously,
	nested scripts were simply not handled correctly, leading to stack overflow
	or other serious problems.  It should now be fixed.

	* added src/Functions/FCN_skew,FCN_mean,FCN_var,FCN_stdev,FCN_rms,FCN_median,
	FCN_kurt,FCN_imin,FCN_imax,FCN_gmean,FCN_adev so the various statistics
	can be obtained easier than via the STATISTICS command.

	* modified src/Functions/FCN_time,FCN_date to fix more bugs in the TIME
	and DATE functions.
	
27/03/2007  Joe Chuma <chuma@triumf.ca>

	v4.1.8 (for various reasons, 4.1.8 was skipped)
	
06/03/2007  Joe Chuma <chuma@triumf.ca>

	v4.1.7

	there are no major tic marks showing

	not being recognized

	* added optional support for MINUIT (minimization code from CERN)

	* modified src/Commands/CMD_scalar to allow limits on fit parameters
	destined for use in MINUIT, e.g., SCALAR\FIT A[min:max].  These limits
	are ignored by the FIT command.

	* modified src/Graphics/GRA_ditheringPlot, GRA_gradientPlot and
	src/Parsing/ParseLine to remove un-named temporary to be passed as a reference
	to const argument to a function.

	* modified src/Utilities/ExGlobals to fix a bug with the PAUSE command.
	A pause in a second level macro (one called by another macro)  was causing
	all scripts to stop after the pause.

	* modified src/Graphics/GRA_axis to fix a bug in drawing a linear axis
	when the virtual min and/or max are within the axis min/max.
	
08/02/2007  Joe Chuma <chuma@triumf.ca>

	work and not seg.fault.

	in the description of the format

	* modified src/Commands/CMD_statistics to fix the calculation of the median

	* modified src/Parsing/ParseLine to fix a bug so that a qualifier can

	* added  extrema.spec extrema.desktop extrema_icons.tar.bz2 to the distribution
	
	* modified src/Command/CMD_set and src/Utilities/ExGlobals to add ECHOON
	characteristic.  ECHOON controls whether an executing script is displayed
	in the command history and message window.

	* modified src/Commands/CMD_read and src/Commands/CMD_write so that the
	file path defaults to the current directory.

	* modified src/Commands/CMD_set to fix a bug when setting AUTOSCALE ON\VIRTUAL

	* modified src/Commands/CMD_destroy, src/Variables/TextVariable and
	src/Variables/TVariableTable to fix a bug when DESTROYing a text variable

	* renamed extremaHelp/ back to Help/ and extremaImages/ back to /Images
	These directories will now be placed, by default, in /usr/local/share/extrema/

	* Makefile.am : added fonts/ directory to the distribution
	These TrueType fonts are freely available, but the user must install them.
	The SYMBOL font is neccessary for the special symbols such as <alpha>, <beta>, etc.

	* fixed the QUIT command so the quit dialog only has "Yes" and "No" buttons
	and if you click "No", the program does not quit
	
	* modified src/Functions/FCN_iclose.cpp
	default calculated index was initialised to 1 instead of 0

	* added new characteristic MAXHISTORY
	MAXHISTORY controls how many history records are stored for each variable

	* modified src/wxForms/FontChooser.h
	added #include "wx/notebook.h"

	* modified src/wxForms/FitForm.h
	changed 'std::size_t nFree_;'  to  'unsigned int nFree_;'

	* modified src/Commands/CMD_fit.cpp
	changed 'std::size_t nfree=0;'  to  'unsigned int nfree=0;'

	* modified src/wxForms/AnalysisWindow.h

	* modified src/Commands/CMD_density.h, src/Commands/Command.h, src/Functions/ScalarFunction.h, and
	src/Graphics/GRA_window.h to remove extraneous class qualifiers, as more recent compilers
	complain about this (submitted by S.Umar)

	* modified src/Utilities/ExGlobals.h and .cpp to rationalize the locations for the help and image
	files they now go to $(prefix)/share with "make install"
	also modified VisualizationSpeedButtonPanel.cpp, PeakFindForm.cpp, ChooseFilePanel.cpp, and
	AnalysisSpeedButtonPanel.cpp to accommodate the new image file location
