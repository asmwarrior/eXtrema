To make use of the symbol font, if it is not already
available on your system, first make an extrema/ subdirectory of
/usr/share/fonts and copy the symbol and wingding files to that location.
For example:

$sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/fonts/extrema
$sudo install -m 644 extrema-x.x.x/fonts/* /usr/share/fonts/extrema/
$sudo mkfontscale /usr/share/fonts/extrema
$fc-cache -f

If you do not have root privileges, you can use ~/.local/fonts/extrema 
to keep a private copy of these fonts.
